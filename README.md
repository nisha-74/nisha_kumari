## 👋 About Me

I’m a **Results-Driven Android Software Engineer** with **2.5+ years** of hands-on experience architecting and building scalable, high-performance mobile applications. My toolkit spans **Kotlin**, **Java**, and **Flutter**, and I thrive on solving complex problems by:

- **Asynchronous Programming**  
  Leveraging Kotlin Coroutines and RxJava to keep UIs silky-smooth and data flows dead-simple.

- **Modern Architectures**  
  Designing apps with **MVVM**, Clean Architecture, and Jetpack components to ensure code is modular, testable, and maintainable.

- **UI/UX Excellence**  
  Crafting intuitive interfaces using **Jetpack Compose** and Material Design principles—and iterating quickly through user feedback.
- **DSA & Problem-Solving**  
  Strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms honed through LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks challenges—enabling me to debug faster and optimize performance.

  - GeeksforGeeks: [nishakumari77109](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/user/nishakumari77109/)


- **Collaborative Development**  
  Comfortable in cross-functional teams, pairing with designers, QA, and backend engineers to deliver end-to-end features on time and to spec.

- **Continuous Learning**  
  I stay up to date by following Android releases, exploring Flutter plugins, and contributing to open-source libraries when I can.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Smart Fitnex App

Built a **real-time exercise coaching** app using **Google’s ML Kit Pose Detection** to guide users through 25+ exercises:

- **Pose Detection & Error Analysis**  
  • Integrated ML Kit’s Pose API to capture key joint coordinates on each video frame  
  • Defined per-exercise angle thresholds to detect misalignments  
  • Calculated deviation vectors (e.g., hip, knee, shoulder angles) to pinpoint form errors  

- **Real-Time Audio Feedback**  
  • Implemented Text-to-Speech (TTS) to immediately correct posture (“Keep your back straight,” “Raise your knee higher”)  
  • Designed a feedback loop so corrective cues trigger within 200 ms of detecting an error  

- **Adaptive Workout Flow**  
  • Organized 25+ exercises into customizable routines  
  • Tracked rep counts and exercise duration using on-device inference for offline reliability  
  • Stored session logs locally and synced summary stats to Firebase for progress tracking  

- **Performance & UX**  
  • Optimized model inference with **ML Kit’s GPU acceleration** for stable 30 fps on mid-range devices  
  • Designed a clean, minimal UI in Jetpack Compose with visual overlays showing skeleton keypoints
